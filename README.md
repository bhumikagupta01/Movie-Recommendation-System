# Movie-Recommendation-System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project repository! This project utilizes content-based learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations based on the attributes of movies and user preferences.

Overview
In this project, we have developed a recommendation system that suggests movies similar to those the user has liked previously. The system analyzes the characteristics of movies, such as genres, keywords, and possibly cast and crew information, to generate recommendations.

Dataset
We used the TMDB movie metadata dataset, which can be accessed through this link. The dataset contains information about various movies, including their titles, genres, keywords, and more.

Libraries Used
To build and analyze the recommendation system, we utilized the following Python libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Streamlit
Pickle
NLTK
Usage
To use the Movie Recommendation System:

Download the dataset from the provided link.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided to explore the recommendation system and generate movie suggestions.
File Structure
recommendation_system.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the recommendation system.
data/: Folder containing the TMDB movie metadata dataset.
requirements.txt: File listing the required Python libraries and their versions.
Results
We have provided examples of movie recommendations generated by the system in the Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to explore and test the recommendation system with your favorite movies!
